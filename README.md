WIP of some tools for intuitive VR experience creation.

Current Goal is to have a two part interface system that a non-coder can sue to create a basic VR experience. Part one of the interface is to have a plan view where you can drag and drop 3D models and do basic manipulations such as position, scale, and rotation. Part two of the interface is in VR or camera view space with additional manipulators for fine tuning arrangements. Additions after that include the ability to animate some basic transforms and a miniature plan view within vr space allowing for larger manipulations.
Steps include:
 - setup a basic 3d space setup with 2 cameras (one of which if the plan view) and a gui to switch between
 - add drag and drop importing of 3D models
 - add manipulators for the models
 - add ability to add lights
 - add gui for other basic features such as world color
 - add VR capability
 - add VR based manipulators
 - develop some gestural controls for VR space
 - add mini plan view model in VR space for larger manipulations
 - add timeline for animations
